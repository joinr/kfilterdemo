* kfilter

A port of the python demo from [[https://scipy-cookbook.readthedocs.io/items/KalmanFiltering.html][Python kalman filter demo]].

* Usage

You can see the tail of the script in kfilter.core, which 
invokes the charting functions via input:

(let [res (experiment-infix (init))]
  (i/view (estimate-plot res))
  (i/view (estimated-apriori-plot res)))

This will produce two charts, rendered via incanter.charts 
and (currently) JFreeChart like these:

[[./chart1.png][chart1]]
[[./chart2.png][chart2]]
